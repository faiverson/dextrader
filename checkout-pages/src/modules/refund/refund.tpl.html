    <h1>Dex Trader Refund Policy</h1>

    <p>TDex Trader offers a 30-day satisfaction guarantee on all initial fees paid to the company. When a refund is
        requested, the bonuses and commissions attributable to the refunded service will be deducted from the Affiliate
        who received bonuses or commissions on such sales. Deductions will occur in the month in which the refund is
        given and continue every pay period thereafter until the commission is recovered.</p>

    <p>To cancel your subscription or request a refund on your order, please submit a support ticket to
