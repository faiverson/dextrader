    <h1>Disclosure</h1>

    <p>Forex and Binary Options trading is speculative, involves substantial risk and is not suitable for all
        investors. Consider the suitability of Forex/Binary Options trading before making any investment decision.</p>

    <p>Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.</p>

    <p>Trading foreign exchange or binary options on margin carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for
        all
        investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you.</p>

    <p>Before deciding to trade foreign exchange or binary options you should carefully consider your investment
        objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some
        or
        all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose.
        You should be fully aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange or binary options trading. If you do
        not
        fully understand and acknowledge the above, you should seek the advice of independent consultants.</p>

    <p>Should you have any questions, please contact us.</p>

    <h2>INHERENT RISKS IN TRADING</h2>

    <p>HYPOTHETICAL OR SIMULATED PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE CERTAIN LIMITATIONS. UNLIKE AN ACTUAL PERFORMANCE RECORD,
        SIMULATED RESULTS DO NOT REPRESENT ACTUAL TRADING. ALSO, SINCE THE TRADES HAVE NOT BEEN EXECUTED, THE RESULTS
        MAY
        HAVE UNDER-OR-OVER COMPENSATED FOR THE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF CERTAIN MARKET FACTORS, SUCH AS LACK OF LIQUIDITY.
        SIMULATED TRADING PROGRAMS IN GENERAL ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE DESIGNED WITH THE BENEFIT OF
        HINDSIGHT. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAN ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFIT OR LOSSES
        SIMILAR TO
        THOSE SHOWN.</p>

    <p>Hypothetical or simulated performance results have certain inherent limitations. Unlike an actual performance
        record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not actually been
        executed,
        the results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack
        of
        liquidity. Simulated trading programs in general are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the
        benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or
        losses similar to those shown. Dex Trader is only sharing information in good faith and is not making any
