<p>Say:</p>
<p>Hey! What’s up?</p>

<p>I know it’s been a while, but I wanted to reach out. I hope you and yours are doing well. Let me know what you are up
    to these days.</p>
<hr>
<small>*** when they reply,</small>

<p>Say:

<p>Ok awesome… (put in your own reply about what they say)...</p>

<p>Listen… this might seem a bit direct but I’m really feeling optimistic and I’ve got something that can quite possibly
    change your life… don’t worry it’s not MLM! If you’re open to looking at a tested method to generate more money, let
    me know.</p>

<p>At first, I had my doubts but the iron clad 30 day money back guarantee tipped me over the edge, and WOW.. I think
    you’ll be impressed just like I was.</p>


<p>I don’t want to push anything on you -- just let me know if you want to take a look and I’ll shoot you some info…
    sound good?</p>

<hr>
<small>*** when they reply, only if they want to see it -- THEN send them the info.</small>
<p>Say:</p>

<p>Ok awesome. Go through this site in full -- there’s great info and we’re doing a launch so you can win some good
    prizes if you want.</p>

<p>When do you think you’ll be able to take a look?</p>
